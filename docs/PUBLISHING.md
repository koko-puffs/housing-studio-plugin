# Publishing Housing Studio's plugin

How to turn this folder into its own repository, release it, and let players install it from a
custom plugin repository.

## 1. Make the repository

1. On GitHub, create **koko-puffs/housing-studio-plugin** (public, so `raw.githubusercontent.com`
   and release downloads work for everyone). Don't add a README, licence or .gitignore; they're here.
2. Pick the licence. `LICENSE` is **AGPL-3.0**, the norm for Dalamud plugins (Dalamud itself is
   AGPL-3.0, and the official repository expects open source). If you'd rather use another licence,
   replace `LICENSE` now; the bundled fonts keep their own OFL licences either way.
3. Move this folder over, keeping its history. From the kokos-tools checkout:

   ```sh
   git subtree split --prefix=dalamud-plugin -b plugin-export
   mkdir ../housing-studio-plugin && cd ../housing-studio-plugin
   git init -b main
   git pull ../kokos-tools plugin-export
   git remote add origin https://github.com/koko-puffs/housing-studio-plugin.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   (Or just copy the folder's contents, hidden `.github/` and `.gitignore` included, into a fresh
   repo and push.) Afterwards, delete `dalamud-plugin/` and `.vercelignore` from kokos-tools if you
   like, and drop the `dalamud-plugin/**` ignores from `.oxlintrc.json`, `eslint.config.ts` and
   `vitest.config.ts`.
4. In the new repo: **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → Read and write
   permissions** → Save. The release workflow needs it to create releases and update `repo.json`.

The **Build** workflow now runs on every push: it downloads the current Dalamud, runs the tests, builds
the plugin and keeps the zip as an artifact.

## 2. Release a version

1. Bump `<Version>` in `HousingStudio/HousingStudio.csproj` if you like (the workflow overrides it
   with the tag anyway).
2. Tag and push:

   ```sh
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

   (Or Actions → Release → Run workflow, with a version.)
3. The **Release** workflow builds with DalamudPackager, creates the GitHub release **v0.1.0** with
   `HousingStudio.zip`, then commits an updated `repo.json` to `main`: `AssemblyVersion`,
   `DalamudApiLevel`, the three `DownloadLink*` URLs pointing at that release's zip, and `LastUpdate`.
4. Check it:
   - The release page has `HousingStudio.zip` (with `HousingStudio.dll`, `HousingStudio.json`, the
     licences).
   - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koko-puffs/housing-studio-plugin/main/repo.json` shows the new
     version and links (raw.githubusercontent caches for a few minutes).
   - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koko-puffs/housing-studio-plugin/main/HousingStudio/images/icon.png`
     loads (it's the installer's icon).

## 3. Install it in the game

Players (and you, for testing):

1. In game, type `/xlsettings` (or Dalamud Settings from the system menu).
2. **Experimental** tab → **Custom Plugin Repositories** → paste
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koko-puffs/housing-studio-plugin/main/repo.json` → press **+**
   → make sure it's ticked (enabled) → **Save and Close**.
3. `/xlplugins` → **All Plugins** → search **Housing Studio** → **Install**.
4. `/hstudio` opens it.

For testing a build before releasing: Dalamud Settings → Experimental → **Dev Plugin Locations**, add
the full path to `HousingStudio/bin/x64/Debug/HousingStudio.dll`, then enable it under Dev Tools →
Installed Dev Plugins.

## 4. Things to know

- **Not vetted.** Custom repositories aren't reviewed by goatcorp (Dalamud's maintainers). Dalamud
  shows a warning when you add one; players install at their own trust. Say plainly in the repo's
  README what the plugin does.
- **Square Enix's terms of service.** Any third-party tool is against them, and plugins that act in
  the game for you (here: moving furniture through the game's own functions) are the kind the
  official Dalamud repository doesn't accept. That's why this lives in a custom repository. Don't
  talk about it in the game.
- **After every game patch** the API level may go up and the game's code moves:
  - When Dalamud releases a new API (e.g. 16), update `Dalamud.NET.Sdk/15.0.0` in
    `HousingStudio.csproj` to the new SDK version, fix what the compiler flags, and release; the
    workflow fills `DalamudApiLevel` from the build. Until then Dalamud won't load the old plugin.
  - The byte patterns (`Game/HousingEditor.cs`, `Game/FurnitureReader.cs`, `Game/PlaceAnywhere.cs`)
    and the editor's offsets may break after a patch even with the same API. The plugin then says it
    couldn't find them and does nothing. The maintained MakePlace forks (RemakePlace/plugin,
    Drakansoul/DisPlace) usually update theirs within days; copy the new patterns from there.
  - During Dalamud's testing period for a patch, `stg/latest.zip` (see `DALAMUD_ZIP` in
    `release.yml`) has the next API, for building ahead of time.
- **Submitting to the official repository** (if the plugin ever drops the automation): see
  dalamud.dev's submission guide, and its AI usage policy (this code was written with AI assistance
  and would need disclosing).
